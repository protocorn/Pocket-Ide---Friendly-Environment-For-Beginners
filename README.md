# Pocket-Ide---Friendly-Environment-For-Beginners
There are many IDE(Integrated Development Environments) available on the Play Store for writing programs in Android OS, but most of them are quite difficult to use and they are no quite user friendly. Especially beginners find them very difficult to use.
To overcome these problems, we are preparing a user friendly, easy to use and most of all a reliable application where users can write and run programs in programming languages like  C, C++ and Java.
This application will be like a portable IDE where users can write, edit and run programs in their palms.
